# Fraud Detection Project

This project implements a **Fraud Detection System** using machine learning techniques. It is designed to identify fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset.

## Overview

Fraud detection is critical for financial institutions. This project:
- Uses a `RandomForestClassifier` to classify transactions as fraud or non-fraud.
- Provides clear performance evaluation with:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC Curve
  - Precision-Recall Curve
- Includes visualizations for better interpretability.
